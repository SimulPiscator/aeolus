AEOLUS 0.9.8  BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (LINUX)
_______________________________________


To build this version, you need to have the shared
libraries (or newer releases with the same major version):

*  libzita-alsa-pcmi.so.0.3.*
*  libclthreads.so.2.4.*
*  libclxclient.so.3.9.*

and the corresponding header files installed.
They should be available from the same place where
you obtained the Aeolus sources.

Three binary files will be made:

*  aeolus            main program, 
*  aeolus_x11.so     GUI plugin,
*  aeolus_txt.so     text mode user interface.

In this version the latter is functional but not complete.

The default Makefile will install the Aeolus binary
in /usr/local/bin, and the user interface plugins in
/usr/local/lib (or /usr/local/lib64 on 64-bit systems).

The modify this you can edit the PREFIX definition in
the Makefile. It is not possible to just move the plugins
to another location without recompilation as the path
to them will be compiled into the aeolus binary.

To make:

*  cd to the directory containing the source files
*  make
*  (as root) make install

After a successful install you may do a 'make clean'.

Please report any problems (and solutions) to <fons@linuxaudio.org>.

See also the README file for run-time configuration.
